GENETIC EXPERIMENTS IN RUBY
8******************************3

~~~ All Code is GPL Licenced and is totally Free! ~~~~

A series of random experiments am making to explore Genetic Algorithms,
their applications in machine learning, scheduling, knowledge-discovery, etc.

I have picked Ruby as the language of choice in all these experiments for one
reason:

Ruby is beautiful to write, and it restores the fun / pleasure to painful / hard problems :-)

Feel free to fork this work, contribute and advise on improvements - am just a hobbyist learning
this stuff on my own mostly lol
